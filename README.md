# quadfoam
Framework providing microsructure optimization on irregular quad-meshes. 

The code was designed in the context of paper ["A Low-parametric Rhombic Microstructure Family for Irregular Lattices"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386569.3392451), presented in SIGGRAPH 2020.

**We are currently working on cleaning and organizing our code. It's going to be available soon for the public in this url.**
